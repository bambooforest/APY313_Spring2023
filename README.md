## Other information

**Respectful participation and conduct**: Open and mutually respectful communication of varied opinions, beliefs,  and perspectives encourages the free exchange of ideas that is essential to higher learning. We welcome debate  and critical arguments but do not tolerate harassment or discrimination. Conduct that is disrespectful can result in  dismissal from the course. For example, there is zero tolerance for comments that are racist, sexist, homophobic,  transphobic, xenophobic, or that demonstrate other forms of discriminatory language. 

**Academic Integrity**: The University of Miami Honor Code applies to all students. Violations of this policy  include all forms of scholastic dishonesty, such as plagiarism, cheating on an examination, copying or  collaborating on assignments without permission, fabrication or falsification of data or records, and other forms  of deceit, dishonesty, or inappropriate conduct. Violations of academic integrity for any assignment may result in  no credit being received for that assignment. As a serious ethical and legal violation, it can further result in failure  of the course and possible dismissal from UM. Please see the detailed Honor Code for further information:  https://doso.studentaffairs.miami.edu/student-conduct/index.html

A bias incident may take the form of a verbal interaction, cyber-interaction, physical interaction, or interaction  with property.
